## Principal-Component-Pursuit: Robust Principal Component Analysis

This short notebook file provides a rather short and concise intro to (without getting into the depths of the preceding classical Principal Component Analysis) the Principal Component Pursuit algorithm which facilitates a powerful way to extract the relevant information from a contaminated dataset. It has many contemporary applications in data science including but not limited to face recognition and video surveillance. 

For an explicit implementation, we apply the PCP algorithm to the electricity prices data in the power markets, with an aim to seperate the standard seasonal behavior from that of the anamolous spikes in the electricity prices.
